# Maycomb Tribune

This is the repo of the app and website that I have created for the maycomb tribune. The maycomb tribune is the newspaper in the novel *To Kill a Mockingbird* by Harper Lee. It is run by Mr. Underwood who is the sole journalist in the town. I have tried to recreate if it were a modern website.
