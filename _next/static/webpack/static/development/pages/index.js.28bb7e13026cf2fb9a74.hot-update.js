Tom, a black man, was accused of raping Mayella, a white woman. In this article we interview Mayella and we see what her reacition has been to this ordeal.\\nWhen asked about the situation, she responded by saying that “Atticus didn't give me no time to think, I couldn't have responded well under that stress”. As the event was taking place Atticus asked some very thoughtful questions examining the responses from Mayella and Bob. These led to some issues for Mayella to answer as the questions where more on point. %%['i', '/static/mayella1.png', 'Mayella answering cross-examination']%% Through the duration of her testimony she got angrier and and angrier until it got to the point where she said “I got somethin‘ to say an’ then I ain’t gonna say no more. That [ guy ] yonder took advantage of me an‘ if you fine fancy gentlemen don’t wanta do nothin’ about it then you’re all yellow stinkin‘ cowards, stinkin’ cowards, the lot of you. Your fancy airs don’t come to nothin‘—your ma’amin’ and Miss Mayellerin‘ don’t come to nothin’, Mr. Finch”. When she was asked about this statement, she simply said “I had ev'ry right to do so. I was being backed into a corner.” %%['i', '/static/mayella2.png', 'Mayella getting mad during her testimony']%% When I tried to ask her more questions, she simply refused and I had to back away. From what I garnered, Mayella still has a secret she doesn't want to say.\",\"id\":\"0\"},{\"name\":\"Interviewing Tom Robinson\",\"summary\":\"An interview to Tom Robinson\",\"article\":\"As I am sure you are all aware, the recent court case involved Tom Robinson as the defendant. He was accused of having raped Mayella Ewell. Throughout the court case, he was in the adverse position. This led to him being accused. Throughout the case, he was proven innocent by Atticus, but he went too far when he said that he “felt sorry for [ Mayella ]”. This inevitably led to the jury being against him. %%['i', '/static/tom1.png', 'Tom saying he felt sorry for Mayella']%% When asked about the ordeal, Tom said that he thought he had no chance and when the jury voted him guilty he was crestfallen. He said that “even though Atticus tried his best, there was nothing that could be done for me.”\",\"id\":\"1\"},{\"name\":\"Interviewing Bob Ewell\",\"summary\":\"An interview to Bob Ewell\",\"article\":\"Robert E. Lee Ewell is the father of Mayella Ewell. His invlovement in the case is that of providing his testimony and he allegedly scared away Tom Robinson. He is a cocky man who thinks that the case is in the bag in is daughter's favor. \",\"id\":\"2\"},{\"name\":\"Interviewing Attcus\",\"summary\":\"An interview to Atticus in the aftermath of the court case\",\"article\":\"The recent court case had one player that almost turned the tides. That was Tom Robinson's lawyer Atticus Finch. He managed to almost turn the tides on a case that would have seemed impossible to most people. the big reason he did so well was his eloquent speaking and poised nature. %%['i', '/static/atticus1.png', 'Atticus giving his speech to the jury']%% In his speach he mentioned some great points about the case. The first point the he makes is that the “The case should never ave come to trial” because “the state has not produced one iota of medical evidence to the effect that the crime Tom Robinson is charged with ever took place. It has relied instead upon the testimony of two witnesses whose evidence has not only been called into serious question on cross-examination, but has been flatly contradicted by the defendant”. Here Atticus has made the point that this case is unjust but the evidence produced by the testimonies i invalid. He calls on the jury to use their judgement instead of just convicting Tom Robinson. However the jury still convicts Tom. %%['i', '/static/atticus2.png', 'Atticus receiving a standing ovation when he leaves']%% When asked about the case Atticus said that in a different time or place, his case would have been received much better. would that be the case now?\",\"id\":\"3\"}]");
