{"pageProps":{"name":"Interviewing Mayella","summary":"An interview to Mayella Ewell","article":"Recently, the focus has all been on the court case between Tom Robinson and Mayella Ewell. Tom, a black man, was accused of raping Mayella, a white woman. In this article we interview Mayella and we see what her reacition has been to this ordeal.\nWhen asked about the situation, she responded by saying that “Atticus didn't give me no time to think, I couldn't have responded well under that stress”. As the event was taking place Atticus asked some very thoughtful questions examining the responses from Mayella and Bob. These led to some issues for Mayella to answer as the questions where more on point. %%[\"i\", \"/static/mayella1.png\", \"Mayella answering cross-examination\"]%% Through the duration of her testimony she got angrier and and angrier until it got to the point where she said “I got somethin‘ to say an’ then I ain’t gonna say no more. That [ guy ] yonder took advantage of me an‘ if you fine fancy gentlemen don’t wanta do nothin’ about it then you’re all yellow stinkin‘ cowards, stinkin’ cowards, the lot of you. Your fancy airs don’t come to nothin‘—your ma’amin’ and Miss Mayellerin‘ don’t come to nothin’, Mr. Finch”. When she was asked about this statement, she simply said “I had ev'ry right to do so. I was being backed into a corner.” %%[\"i\", \"/static/mayella2.png\", \"Mayella getting mad during her testimony\"]%% When I tried to ask her more questions, she simply refused and I had to back away. From what I garnered, Mayella still has a secret she doesn't want to say.","id":"0"},"__N_SSG":true}
