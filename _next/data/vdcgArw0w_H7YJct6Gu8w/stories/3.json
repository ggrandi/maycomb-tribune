That was Tom Robinson's lawyer Atticus Finch. He managed to almost turn the tides on a case that would have seemed impossible to most people. the big reason he did so well was his eloquent speaking and poised nature. %%[\"i\", \"/static/atticus1.png\", \"Atticus giving his speech to the jury\"]%% In his speach he mentioned some great points about the case. The first point the he makes is that the “The case should never ave come to trial” because “the state has not produced one iota of medical evidence to the effect that the crime Tom Robinson is charged with ever took place. It has relied instead upon the testimony of two witnesses whose evidence has not only been called into serious question on cross-examination, but has been flatly contradicted by the defendant”. Here Atticus has made the point that this case is unjust but the evidence produced by the testimonies i invalid. He calls on the jury to use their judgement instead of just convicting Tom Robinson. However the jury still convicts Tom. %%[\"i\", \"/static/atticus2.png\", \"Atticus receiving a standing ovation when he leaves\"]%% When asked about the case Atticus said that in a different time or place, his case would have been received much better. would that be the case now?","id":"3"},"__N_SSG":true}
